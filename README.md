Data analysis and Visualization using Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib

I have performed data analysis and visualization using pandas, numpy, and matplotlib. This analysis will help in understanding the factors contributing to heart disease, distribution of variables, and other key insights.

Data Loading and Preprocessing:
• Load the dataset using pandas.

• Handle any missing values appropriately.

• Convert categorical variables into dummy/indicator variables.

Data Analysis:
• Calculate the average age of patients with and without heart disease.

• Determine the distribution of chest pain types among patients.

• Find the correlation between thalach (maximum heart rate) and age.

• Analyze the effect of sex on the presence of heart disease.

Data Visualization:
• Plot a histogram of the age distribution of patients.

• Create a bar chart showing the distribution of chest pain types among patients.

• Plot a scatter plot to show the relationship between thalach (maximum heart rate) and age.

• Create a box plot to compare the age distribution of patients with and without heart disease.

Advanced Analysis (using numpy):
• Calculate the correlation matrix for all numerical features in the dataset.

• Perform a rolling mean analysis on the chol (cholesterol) levels with a window size of 5 and plot it.

Bonus: I have created a function that can take a patient’s data as input and return a prediction of whether they have heart disease based on simple thresholding rules.

• Use subplots to combine multiple visualizations into one figure for better comparison.**
